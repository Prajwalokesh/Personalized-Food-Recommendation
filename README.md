Personalized Food Recommendation System 🍎🤖
Introduction

Individuals with dietary restrictions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or severe allergies, often struggle to make safe and healthy food choices. Our project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI)—using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for food image recognition and Large Language Models (LLM) for reasoning—to provide real-time, personalized food recommendations. By simply scanning a meal, users can receive tailored suggestions, ensuring safer and healthier eating habits.

Key Features

📷 Food Image Analysis – Detects and classifies food items using CNN with 70% accuracy.

🧠 AI-powered Reasoning – Uses LLM to suggest portion sizes, alternatives, and dietary advice.

🌐 MERN Stack Integration – Smooth frontend and backend handling for real-time processing.

💊 Health-Aware Recommendations – Personalized suggestions based on chronic diseases or allergies.

📊 Tested & Validated – Model shows promising results in classification and dietary recommendation accuracy.

🚀 Future Enhancements – Expanding dataset, improving accuracy, and adding broader chronic disease coverage.
